I'm a research scientist specializing in computational biology and bioinformatics at Colorado State University. I build scalable workflows for genomic analysis, develop creative solutions for HPC implementation challenges, and bridge computational methods with experimental biology to advance our understanding of gene regulation and infectious disease dynamics. My approach combines technical rigor with innovative problem-solving to transform biological questions into actionable computational strategies.
